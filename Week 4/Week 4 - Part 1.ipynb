Since the biggest companies are located in the capital, fresh grads from different regions of the country are likely to relocate in a city that is mostly unknown for them. Therefore, it’s important for them to get access to the services that provide information necessary to select a new place to settle for a new life. And basically, this could be of use to anyone looking to relocate in the capital."
